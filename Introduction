# Research-regarding-light-detection-of-COVID-19
Earlier, mass spectrometry based assays for identification of microbial pathogens
were limited to detection of microbes from pure cultures and not capable of detecting
pathogens directly from clinical specimens such as nasopharyngeal swabs. Viruses range in
size from 10-300nm.Spectroscopy signatures of laser properties can be used to identify
single viral structural features. Size of the virus is identified by observing the amount of light
scattering.
Photonics technology can be used to achieve remote monitoring of COVID-19
propagation through a multi-sensor intelligent network and contribute to diagnosing
COVID-19. Fiber lasers are used to process data efficiently and reliably, are stable and
scalable, and are a highly accurate tool in the diagnostics of viruses.
